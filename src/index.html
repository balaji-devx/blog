    Sir Timothy John Berners-Lee (born 8 June 1955), also known as TimBL, is an English computer scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system, and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).
    Berners-Lee proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent development. He is the founder and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. In 2004, Berners-Lee was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II for his pioneering work. He received the 2016 Turing Award "for inventing the World Wide Web, the first web browser, and the fundamental protocols and algorithms allowing the Web to scale".

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 15px;">
    Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer scientists Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee, who worked on the Ferranti Mark 1, the first commercially-built computer. From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class BA in physics. While at university, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 15px;">
    After graduation, Berners-Lee worked as an engineer at the telecommunications company Plessey in Poole. In 1980, he was a fellow at CERN, where he first developed a project using hypertext for information sharing. In 1989, he saw an opportunity to join hypertext with the Internet. He wrote his proposal in March 1989 for a large hypertext database with typed links, but it generated little interest. His boss at CERN, Mike Sendall, encouraged him to begin implementing his system on a NeXT workstation. By Christmas 1990, he had built all the tools necessary for a working Web: the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), the first Web browser (named WorldWideWeb), the first HTTP server software, and the first web pages that described the project itself.

  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem; margin-top: 10px; line-height: 1.6; padding: 15px;">
    In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at MIT. He made his idea available freely, with no patent and no royalties due. The W3C decided that its standards should be based on royalty-free technology, so they could easily be adopted by anyone. For his creation, he has received numerous awards, including the Turing Award, often called the "Nobel Prize of Computing." Today, he remains a vocal advocate for net neutrality and the privacy of user data on the web he created.
